1. Create the Environment
Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows) and use the conda create command.

With a specific Python version (Recommended):
conda create --name myenv python=3.10

2. Activate the Environment

Once created, you must "enter" the environment to use its specific Python interpreter and libraries.

Standard command:

conda activate myenv
